# Gatorverse Hackathon 2025 – Submissions

Welcome to the official submission space for the ACM Allegheny Gatorverse Hackathon (April 12–13, 2025).

All teams should upload their final project materials here.

## Challenge Prompt

Imagine a world where experts from diverse fields – designers, engineers, business strategists, artists, scientists – can seamlessly collaborate to solve complex problems.

Your challenge is to create a tool, platform, or experience that facilitates and enhances this interdisciplinary collaboration.

Think about the common barriers to teamwork across disciplines: communication, understanding different perspectives, and integrating diverse skill sets.

Develop a solution that addresses these challenges and empowers teams to achieve greater synergy.
